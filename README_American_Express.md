# American Express Credit Risk Analysis 🏦

This project simulates a real-world scenario for predicting credit defaults using a dataset inspired by credit card and loan behavior (e.g., American Express). It uses Python and machine learning to classify whether a customer is likely to default on their loan.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze customer data and build machine learning models that can predict whether a customer will default (`1`) or not (`0`), based on various financial features.

---

## 📁 Dataset

Simulated dataset includes the following features:

- `age`
- `income`
- `loan_amount`
- `credit_score`
- `employment_years`
- `default` (target variable)

📄 Dataset file: [`credit_risk_dataset.csv`](./credit_risk_dataset.csv)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
